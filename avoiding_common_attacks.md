# Avoid Common Attacks

Protect against two attack vectors from the "Smart Contracts" section with its SWC number

## Solidity Pitfalls and Attacks

- Using Specific Compiler Pragma. The project requires specific solidity 0.8.7.

- Proper Use of Require, Assert and Revert. Used in "contract MyHomeEnergyApp".

- Use Modifiers Only for Validation. 

- Pull Over Push (Prioritize receiving contract calls over making contract calls). 

- Checks-Effects-Interactions (Avoiding state changes after external calls).

- Proper use of .call and .delegateCall. The project does not use these functions. 

## Smart Contract Pitfalls and Attacks

Not everything can be avoided, but you can write if youâ€™re taking protection against:
- Re-entrancy (Do not perform external calls in contracts. If you do, ensure that they are the 
very last thing you do)

- Timestamp Dependence (Do not use timestamps in critical parts of the code, because miners can manipulate them.)

- Forcibly Sending Ether. 

- Tx.Origin Authentication (Not using tx.origin for authentication (or indeed, at all).)
