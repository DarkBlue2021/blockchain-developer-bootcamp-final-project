Design patterns:

(1) Inter-Contract Execution (Calling functions in external contracts) Inter-Contract Execution, Part 1 and Part 2

(2) Inheritance and Interfaces (Importing and extending contracts and/or using contract interfaces) Inheritances and Interfaces — (note: this is already a requirement in the final project, so you can simply describe which library or interface you use)

(3) Oracles (retrieving third-party data) Off-Chain Oracles and Chapter 5: Second-Order Effects — Oracles Revisited

(4) Access Control Design Patterns (Restricting access to certain functions using things like Ownable, Role-based Control) Access Control Design Patterns
-> Ownable Design pattern
