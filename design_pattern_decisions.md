Design patterns:

(1) Inheritance and Interfaces (Importing and extending contracts and/or using contract interfaces) Inheritances and Interfaces — (note: this is already a requirement in the final project, so you can simply describe which library or interface you use)

(2) Oracles (retrieving third-party data) Off-Chain Oracles and Chapter 5: Second-Order Effects — Oracles Revisited

(3) Access Control Design Patterns (Restricting access to certain functions using things like Ownable, Role-based Control) Access Control Design Patterns
-> Ownable Design pattern
